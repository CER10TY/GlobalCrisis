Mission Description
======

Welcome, Dariush Gilani. You are an ISI Operative, now working together with the Central Intelligence Agency for the first time in the field, on Altis. 
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard has set up shop around various Altian positions, and is unaware of your small base, which is kept well hidden from aerial view, that is around the southern peninsula. 
Working together with the CIA, you will critically hit the military, be that naval, ground or airspace, installations and troops of the Revolutionary Guard. Your main goal is to cause disarray, not limit their influence.
Welcome to Altis. Welcome to the CIA.
