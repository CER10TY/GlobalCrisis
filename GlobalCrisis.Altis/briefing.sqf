"Iran's Revolutionary Guard has settled down on Altis, effectively disrupting official military operations on the island and seizing control. 
Global Relations have shifted, and as such no military operation has officially launched yet. The CIA and a Pakistani ISI Representative have settled down on the islands southern part, in the hopes of wrestling influence
back towards the AAF. A local Resistance movement is also present on the island, entering the occasional fight with the much-better equipped Revolutionary Guard."]];

"Your initial deployment will be via a parachute drop into the wide open sea. Detection risk has to be kept at minimum, and as such we have scheduled a helicopter pickup once you touch down on water.
The helicopter will be sufficiently marked and have visual aids to help you prepare for landing. When you have arrived at the base, equip yourself and then head over to Mission Control.
It is recommended that you find the various pieces of Intel spread out around the island, to make yourself more familiar with the situation at hand."]];
